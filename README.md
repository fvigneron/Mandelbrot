# Mandelbrot : a numerical microscope to study the Mandelbrot set

`Mandelbrot` is a library, written in C, that aims to be a complete toolbox to study the Mandelbrot set.

We used this library to generate a complete and certified database of all the hyperbolic centers of period $n \leq 41$ and all Misiurewicz-Thurston parameters of preperiod $\ell$ and period $n$ with $\ell+n\leq 35$. This computational challenge was made possible by the use of a new splitting algorithm, based on level lines and introduced in [this article](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-XY). The documentation is availlable on the project's website:

More details comming soon.
